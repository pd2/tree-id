I developed a hang man style game as a web app. The challenge is to identify the tree by clues in the form of pictures of its bark, bud and leaf. Upon each unsuccessful guess of a letter, a new clue is revealed as pictures with the final clue being the Latin name. One can develop their skills for identification of trees. When the player correctly identifies the tree, they will see the time taken by them. One can learn more about natural history.
